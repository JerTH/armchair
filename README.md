# Armchair

#### Description
Armchair is an ARMv7-M emulator. The intent of Armchair is to emulate the behavior of an ARMv7 microcontroller with reasonable accuracy and a simple interface. Behavior is modeled as it is described in the ARMv7-M Reference Manual.

Armchair is intended as a learning tool. It does not promise to be bug free, and does not guarantee behavior which is 100% congruent with any existing real ARM processor.
